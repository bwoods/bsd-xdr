This package contains a port of Sun's XDR library. It was
derived from the implementation in the libtirpc package
(version 0.1.10-7) from Fedora 11. That version was relicensed
with explicit permission from the copyright holder (Sun
Microsystems) to a BSD license.  See the LICENSE file for
more information.

Some of the goals of this port:
  Maintain the BSD license rather than copylefting it, as
    in portableXDR and various other versions.
  Avoid autotools.
  Avoid "config.h" pollution (or similar) in public header files.
  Compile successfully at highest reasonable warning level,
    with warnings treated as errors.
  Compile library as both static and shared.
  Provide thorough tests of all libxdr facilities.
  Where feasible, link test programs against both static and shared
    libraries.
  Verify identical output on a variety of platforms, especially 32-
    and 64-bit hosts.
