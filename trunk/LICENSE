The library (all code under lib/) is derived from the XDR 
components of the libtirpc package from Fedora 11
(libtirpc-0.1.10-7.fc11.src.rpm, as patched by the rpm.spec
and patches included in that package). As patched, the
libtirpc XDR code has been explicitly relicensed by the
copyright owner (Sun Microsystems) to a 3-clause BSD license.
This license is reproduced in full in each of the affected
source files, and is also available in licenses/SunRPC. 

As documented in the libtirpc rpm.spec file from Fedora 11:
* Tue May 19 2009 Tom "spot" Callaway <tcallawa@redhat.com> 0.1.10-7
- Replace the Sun RPC license with the BSD license, with the explicit permission
  of Sun Microsystems

Some other files in this distribution, especially test programs,
may be licensed under certain other free licenses. For the most
part, these are non-copyleft. See below for details.
