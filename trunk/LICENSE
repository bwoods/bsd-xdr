The library (all code under lib/ except xdr_private.h and
xdr_private.c) is derived from the XDR components of the
libtirpc package from Fedora 11 (libtirpc-0.1.10-7.fc11.src.rpm,
as patched by the rpm.spec and patches included in that package).
As patched, the libtirpc XDR code has been explicitly relicensed
by the copyright owner (Sun Microsystems) to a 3-clause BSD license.
This license is reproduced in full in each of the affected source
files, and is also available in licenses/SunRPC.

As documented in the libtirpc rpm.spec file from Fedora 11:
* Tue May 19 2009 Tom "spot" Callaway <tcallawa@redhat.com> 0.1.10-7
- Replace the Sun RPC license with the BSD license, with the explicit
  permission of Sun Microsystems

The two exceptions, lib/xdr_private.h and lib/xdr_private.c, are
provided under the MIT/X license.  The full text of this license is
included in each source file to which it applies, and is also
available in licenses/MIT_X.

Some other files in this distribution, especially test programs,
may be licensed under certain other free licenses. For the most
part, these are non-copyleft. See below for details.

src/getopt.h
src/getopt_long.c
   These are derived from the NetBSD's libgetopt, and are provided
   under a 2-clause BSD license. The full text of this license is
   included in each source file, and is also available in
   licenses/NetBSD. These files are used only by the test programs,
   and only on those platforms that do not provide getopt (namely,
   mingw and msvc). Original location:
     http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/libgetopt/files/

msvc/inttypes.h
msvc/stdint.h
   These are msvc-specific replacements for C99-standard
   headers that are missing from msvc 2005 (8.0) and earlier.
   They (or a suitable similar replacement) are required
   by the visual studio port of bsd-xdr (and should be installed
   along with rpc/xdr.h and rpc/types.h).  They are provided
   under a 3-clause BSD license.  The full text of that license
   is embedded in each source file, and is also available in
   licenses/msinttypes. Original location:
     http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/  (rev. 24).
